## Bash Profile 

## What is .bash_profile

bash_profile is a configuration file for bash shell. When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell it first reads and executes commands from:

```
~/.bash_profile
```

by adding commands, functions and aliases to it, you can make your terminal a lot easier and quicker to use.

if your shell is ZSH, you can also find it under:

```
~/.zshrc
```

if you don't have that file, you can create it!

```
touch ~/.zshrc
```

Don't forget to restart your terminal after you add lines to your bash_profile to make your functions work.

## Improving

my_zshrc file contains things that I find helpful and useful but I will always be updating and improving my .zshrc file according to my needs.
